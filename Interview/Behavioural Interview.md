# Behave

## Values

Innovative, Passionate, Disruptive, Open and Fun.

## STAR Method

- **Situation.** First, define and explain the situation. Describe the company where the situation occurred along with the task involved.  
- **Task.** Then, provide more details regarding the task itself.
- **Action.** Now, outline the action or actions _you chose_ to complete the task or provide a solution. This part of the STAR method is often the most important part of your answer, as it’s your opportunity to display your domain expertise, decision-making, and initiative.
- **Results.** Finally, elaborate on the results of your efforts. Clearly define how your chosen actions lead to demonstrable results, and include data if you can.

## Top big tech questions

"Hi, I have 2.5 years of experience working in the technology industry, primarily focusing on backend development and data science. In my professional journey, I have had the opportunity to work with reputable organizations like CompatibL and Bank of America, where I gained valuable experience in Python programming.

I am passionate about constantly learning and improving my skills in my spare time. This has allowed me to stay updated on the latest industry trends and best practices. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and experiences to new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

1.  Why do you want to work for X company?
2.  Why do you want to leave your current/last company?
3.  What are you looking for in your next role?
   
	I would like to be a part of the team which builds highly-loaded service. Preferably this service should be scalable, containerized and deployed on cloud service e.g. AWS. On the backend it is better be Python / Go
	
	Also it would be nice, if this service would have other components besides backend e.g. caching with Redis, load balancer with NGINX, NoSQL like Mongo.
 
4.  Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a co-worker. 

      **Situation.** A few months ago, I had a conflict with a co-worker who was a front-end developer on our team. We were working on a project to revamp the user interface of one of our core financial applications. As a Python developer, my role was to develop and integrate the back-end services, while my colleague was responsible for creating front-end.
      
      **Task.** During the development phase, we started to encounter issues when integrating the front-end and back-end components. It became apparent that there were discrepancies in how we had implemented the API specifications, which led to multiple bugs and functional problems in the application. My colleague believed that I had not followed the agreed-upon specifications and insisted that I should modify my code to match their implementation.
   
      **Action.** Instead of reacting defensively, I decided to approach the situation calmly and objectively. I requested a meeting with my co-worker to discuss the issue further. During the meeting, we carefully reviewed the API specifications and our respective code implementations. We discovered that both of us had misunderstood certain aspects of the requirements, leading to inconsistencies in our work.
  
      **Result.** Together, we identified the areas where our implementations did not align and agreed on the necessary changes to ensure a seamless integration. I have suggested to improve our communication by scheduling regular sync-ups and code reviews, to prevent similar misunderstandings from happening in the future.
         
      **What have I learnt?** This experience taught me the importance of clear communication, especially when working in cross-functional teams. It also reinforced the value of addressing conflicts in a constructive and collaborative manner, which can lead to better solutions and stronger working relationships.
   
1.  Tell me about a time in which you had a conflict and needed to influence somebody else.
   
   **Situation.** Our team was tasked with developing a new feature that would significantly enhance the capabilities of our financial platform. 
   
   **Task.** During the development process, I realized that the existing database architecture was not optimal for the new feature we were building, as it would lead to performance issues and potential scalability problems in the future. I believed that a different database schema would be more efficient and better suited to support the new functionality.
   
   However, the database architect disagreed with my proposal, expressing concerns about the potential risks and time-consuming process of making such a significant change to the database structure. Given the tight deadline for the project, they were reluctant to implement the modifications I suggested.
   
   **Action.** To influence my co-worker's perspective, I decided to first gather concrete evidence to support my argument. I conducted research and benchmark tests to demonstrate the potential performance improvements and scalability benefits that my proposed solution could offer. I also prepared a detailed plan outlining the necessary steps and resources to minimize the risks associated with the changes.
   
   Once I had gathered this information, I scheduled a meeting with the database architect and presented my findings. I emphasized the long-term benefits of the proposed changes and how they would contribute to the overall success of the project, as well as the growth of our platform. I also acknowledged their concerns and addressed them by highlighting the mitigation strategies in my plan.
   
   **Result.** After a thorough discussion, my co-worker was convinced by the data and agreed to proceed with the modifications to the database architecture. We worked closely together to implement the changes, and the new feature was successfully launched on time. As a result, our platform's performance and scalability significantly improved, ultimately benefiting both our team and the company's clients.
   
   **What have I learnt?** This experience taught me the importance of using data and evidence to support my arguments when trying to influence others. It also reinforced the value of collaboration, empathy, and effective communication when resolving conflicts and working towards a common goal.
